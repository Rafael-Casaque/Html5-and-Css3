    <h2><b>What is HTML?</b></h2>
    <p><i>HTML</i> (<b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage) uses a markup system composed of elements
        which represent specific content. <i>Markup</i> means that with HTML you declare <i>what</i> is presented to a
        viewer, not <i>how</i>
        it is presented. Visual
        representations are defined by <i>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS</i>) and realized by browsers. <i>Still existing
            elements that allow for such</i>, like e.g. <code><i>font</i></code>, "are entirely obsolete, and must not be used by
        authors"[1].</p>

    <p>HTML is sometimes called a programming language but it has no logic, so is a <b>markup language</b>. HTML tags
        provide semantic meaning and machine-readability to the content in the page.</p>

    <p>An element usually consists of an opening tag <code><b>(&lt;element_name/&gt;)</b></code>, a closing tag
        <code><b>(&lt;element_name/&gt;)</b></code>,
        which contain the
        element's name surrounded by angle brackets, and the content in between:
        <code><b>(&lt;element_name/&gt;)</b>...content...<b>(&lt;element_name/&gt;)</b></code>
    </p>

    <p>There are some HTML elements that don't have a closing tag or any contents. These are called void elements. Void
        elements include
        <code><b>&lt;img&gt;</b></code>,<code><b>&lt;meta&gt;</b></code>,<code><b>&lt;link&gt;</b></code> and
        <code><b>&lt;input&gt;</b></code>.
    </p>

    <p>Element names can be thought of as descriptive keywords for the content they contain, such as <code>video</code>,
        <code>audio</code>,<code>table</code>, <code>footer</code>.</p>

    <p>A HTML page may consist of potentially hundreds of elements which are then read by a web browser, interpreted
        and rendered into human readable or audible content on the screen.</p>
